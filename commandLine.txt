Command Line Basics

TO START:
Move the commandLine directory into your Documents directory (using drag and drop)
Open up Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (PC)

You should see a command prompt. What is yours? $ % ??
Before the command prompt, do you see a ~ ? That lets you know you're in your home directory.

If on a Mac, you can run 'exec bash' to switch from zsh to bash for this session (when you close your window it will reset to zsh).

SECTION 1
Listing files in your current directory (aka your working directory, aka where you are now)
Commands in this section:
ls – directory listing
ls -a – listing with hidden files
ls -l – listing in list format
ls -al - listing in list format with hidden files and directories
ls -F - listing with directories labeled
ls <directory> - listing of what is in a specified directory
<tab> - autocomplete filenames
(when you see -a or -l or -alF or -x after a command, these are called flags - flags change the command in some way)


Type:
ls
ks
ls -a
ls -l
ls -al
ls -F
ls -alF
ls Documents
ls -F Documents
ls Documents -F
ls Doc<tab>    OR    ls Documents


Exercise:
Pick a directory inside Documents. List the contents of that directory by creating a longer file path.
Try it using tab complete.
List all the contents of that directory, including any hidden files.


SECTION 2
Changing your current directory (aka moving around in your filesystem)
Commands in this section:
pwd – print working directory
cd <dir> – change directory to <dir>
cd – change to home
cd .. - change to one directory higher

Type:
pwd
ls
cd Documents
pwd
ls
cd ..
pwd
ls
cd Documents
cd commandLine
pwd
ls
cd
pwd
cd Doc<tab> comman<tab>    OR    cd Documents/commandLine
pwd
cd ../../Downloads
pwd
cd ~/Documents/comman<tab>    OR    cd ~/Documents/commandLine


Exercise:
You are in the commandLine directory, inside Documents. 
Can you think of at least two ways you can navigate to the Desktop directory from where you are now?


SECTION 3
Viewing files without exiting the command line
Open up unixcheatsheet.txt in either TextEdit(Mac) or Notepad(PC)
Commands in this section:
less <file> – scroll through the contents of <file>
head <file> – output the first 10 lines of <file>
tail <file> – output the last 10 lines of <file>
<spacebar> - to scroll through "less"
q - to exit "less"

Type:
cd ~/Documents/commandLine
ls
less unixcheatsheet.txt
<spacebar><spacebar>
q
less unixcheat<tab><tab><tab>t<tab>    OR    less unixcheatsheet.txt
q
less unixcheat<tab>p<tab>    OR    less unixcheatsheet.pdf
q
head unixcheatsheet.txt
tail unixcheatsheet.txt


Exercise:
Use less to view this file: commandLine.txt. Use <space> to scroll through the file until the end. Use q to exit.


SECTION 4
Creating a new directory
Commands in this section:
mkdir <dir> – create a directory <dir>


Type:
pwd (make sure you're in the commandLine directory)
ls
mkdir exampleDir
ls
cd exam<tab>    OR    cd exampleDir
ls
cd ..

Exercise:
Make a new directory called "cheatsheets" inside the commandLine directory.


SECTION 5
Copying, moving, and renaming files
Commands in this section:
cp <file1> <file2> – copy <file1> to <file2>
cp -r <dir1> <dir2> – copy <dir1> to <dir2>; create <dir2> if it doesn't exist
mv <file1> <file2> – rename or move <file1> to <file2> ; if <file2> is an existing directory, moves <file1> into directory <file2>

Type:
ls
cp unixcheatsheet.txt unixcheatsheetCOPY.txt
ls
less unix<tab>C<tab>    OR    less unixcheatsheetCOPY.txt
q
ls
mv unix<tab>C<tab> exampleDir    OR    mv unixcheatsheetCOPY.txt exampleDir
ls
ls exampleDir
ls
cp -r exampleDir exampleDir2
ls
ls exampleDir2
mv exampleDir2/unixcheatsheetCOPY.txt exampleDir2/unixcheatsheet2.txt
<up arrow><up arrow> (until you see ls exampleDir2)
ls

Exercise:
Copy the file unixcheatsheet2.txt that is in exampleDir2 into the cheatsheets directory.
Rename the file unix.txt.
You can do this in one or multiple lines of code.


SECTION 6
Deleting files and directories (permanent!!!!!)
Commands in this section:
rm <file> – delete <file> (permanent)
rm -r <dir> – delete directory <dir> (permanent)
rm -f <file> – force remove file (permanent)

Type:
cd ~/Documents/commandLine
cp unixcheatsheet.txt unixTODELETE.txt
ls
rm unixTODELETE.txt
ls
ls exampleDir
rm -r exampleDir
ls

Exercise:
Permanently delete the directory exampleDir2.


SECTION 7
Creating a new empty file
Commands in this section:
touch <file> – create or update <file>

Type:
ls
touch myFile.txt
ls
less myFile.txt
q


SECTION 8
Stopping the current running process
Commands in this section:
ctrl+C - stop current command

Type:
cd
pwd
find *
ctrl+C


SECTION 9
Checking what's running

top - display all running processes
q - to exit "top"

Type:

<spacebar><spacebar>
q

Exercise:
Check out the manual for the cp command. What does the -n flag do?

vi <filename> - opens a file in vi; creates and opens if file doesn't already and exist
i - insert mode; allows editing
<esc> - exits insert mode; allows saving and exiting vi
:q - exit vi if no changes were made to the file
:wq - save changes and exit vi
:q! - do not save changes and exit vi

Type:

<esc>
i
<esc>
:q
vi myFile.txt
i
<add text>
